# Salifort Motors Data Analysis Project

This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of the Salifort Motors dataset, aimed at uncovering insights to drive strategic business decisions. The analysis is structured into several key phases:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - **Libraries Used**: pandas, numpy
   - **Tasks**: Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Libraries Used**: matplotlib, seaborn
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Visualizing the distribution of key variables.
     - Identifying correlations and trends.
     - Analyzing customer demographics and purchase behavior.
     - Creating various plots (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to understand data distributions and relationships.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
     - Normalizing and scaling numerical features.
     - Encoding categorical variables.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Methods Used**: 
     - Descriptive statistics to summarize central tendencies and dispersions.
     - Hypothesis testing to determine statistical significance of observed patterns.
     - Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.

5. **Machine Learning Modeling**:
   - **Libraries Used**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
   - **Models Applied**: 
     - Linear Regression for predicting continuous outcomes.
     - Decision Trees and Random Forests for classification tasks.
     - XGBoost for enhanced predictive performance.
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
     - Training and evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

6. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**:
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Assessing model performance on test data.
     - Interpreting model outputs and feature importance.
     - Visualizing model predictions versus actual values.

7. **Visualization**:
   - **Libraries Used**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
   - **Tasks**: 
     - Creating interactive plots to present findings.
     - Using heatmaps, pair plots, and other advanced visualizations to convey insights clearly.

This notebook provides a detailed step-by-step documentation of the entire analysis process, making it easy to follow and replicate. Each step includes code, outputs, and interpretations to ensure a thorough understanding of the methods and findings.
